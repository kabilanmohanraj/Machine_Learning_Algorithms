# Supervised_Machine_Learning_Algorithms
Python implementation of supervised ML algorithms and ensemble techniques. The code files are in the '.ipynb' format. So, use any of the IPython consoles to access the notebooks.

### General logical flow of the code:
1. Reading data
2. Data visualization
3. Data preprocessing
4. Model creation and fitting
5. Model evaluation
