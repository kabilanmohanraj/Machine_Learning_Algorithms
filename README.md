# Supervised_Machine_Learning_Algorithms
Python implementation of supervised ML algorithms and ensemble techniques. The code files are in the '.ipynb' format. So, use any of the IPython consoles to run the notebooks off the shelf. I've also included the '.py' files to view the files without loading.

The datasets used in the notebooks can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository

### General logical flow of the code:
1. Reading data
2. Data visualization
3. Data preprocessing
4. Model creation and fitting
5. Model evaluation
